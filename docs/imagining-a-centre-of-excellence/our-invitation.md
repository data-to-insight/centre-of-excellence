# Our invitation

With DfE funding, we’re scoping and designing a “Centre of Excellence” – **a national support offer** for data and digital work in children’s social care<sup>[^1]</sup>.

The Centre of Excellence is part of the government's wider reform agenda for children's social care. It should build capacity in the sector to adopt the data and digital changes that come with significant reform, as well as supporting the sector to introduce key national objectives like a Single Unique Identifier and improvements to multi-agency information sharing.<sup>[^2]</sup> Further, it should serve as a sustainable resource for sector-led improvements in local authority data and digital work.

Successfully creating a Centre of Excellence would represent real investment in the capability of local authorities (LAs) and their safeguarding partners to use data and digital in children’s services, and our consortium – Data to Insight, Coram, the LGA, Social Finance, and ICT Revolutions – will design it with the sector, ensuring it works well for individual organisations.

We know this project will only be a success if it works in ways which the sector understands and welcomes. As sector-embedded organisations, we’re starting by laying out what we think, and asking colleagues to challenge and improve our understanding. **Real engagement is crucial to our design work**.
