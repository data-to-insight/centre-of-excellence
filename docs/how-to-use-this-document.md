# <span style="color:dodgerblue">How to use this document</span>

This document is designed to reach a wide readership with varying levels of pre-existing knowledge and interest. 



#### <span style="color:dodgerblue">For an ‘executive summary’</span>

To learn what we’re doing, where this project came from, and what we’re asking you to do, read the next section, under the title “Imagining a Centre of Excellence”. 

This section concludes with links to feedback options so that you can easily tell us what you think.

 

#### <span style="color:dodgerblue">For a brief explanation of key discussion points</span>

The subsequent sections (prior to the appendices) provide important discussion outlining our system analysis, initial ideas for the support offer of a Centre of Excellence, and operating model options.

Within this, our long list of possible support activities for a Centre of Excellence is shown in the section titled "Possible mechanisms for change". 

 

#### <span style="color:dodgerblue">For in-depth discussion of specific problems and opportunities</span>

The remainder of the document provides three appendices which can be read as extensions of the content in the above sections, or as discussion topics in their own right. 

These are useful reference material explaining our thinking and prompting sector feedback, both on our problem analysis and on the validity of our early support ideas, but you can still provide us feedback before you’ve read them.
