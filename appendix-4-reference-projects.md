# Appendix 4: Reference projects

Below is a list of reference projects we’ve learned from to arrive at our current understanding. We recognise that this list is by no means a comprehensive representation of the data and digital activity or expertise in the sector; we provide it to help colleagues identify other important reference points for our design work, as part of our engagement.

During this project, we intend to publish a prototype map of the work happening in the sector, using these projects as a base, and welcoming contributions from colleagues across the sector. We hope that this will become an important and sustainable resource for colleagues.

[^38]:  For example, compare the representation of around 150 LAs in our quarterly RIIA CSC data collection, founded on longstanding national data standards, with the representation of around 90 LAs in our equivalent Early Help data collection, for which no national data standards previously existed.

[^44]:  One small example of this is in how, for the ADCS Safeguarding Pressures 9 survey, LAs were better able to respond to the data component, completed by one internal function, than the qualitative element, which typically necessitated some internal collaboration: [*https://www.adcs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ADCS_Safeguarding_Pressures_Phase9_FINALv1.pdf*](https://www.adcs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ADCS_Safeguarding_Pressures_Phase9_FINALv1.pdf)

[^46]:  We note, for example, little change in LA procurement practice following publication of valid DfE guidance: [*https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childrens-social-care-improving-case-management-systems/improving-case-management-systems-for-childrens-social-care-services*](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childrens-social-care-improving-case-management-systems/improving-case-management-systems-for-childrens-social-care-services)

[^47]:  The Social Finance / Data to Insight tailored apprenticeship has enrolled over 100 learners from core roles which we estimate total around 700 colleagues nationally at any one time. That’s a significant proportion of a workforce which is willing to commit to a sustained learning effort to develop better skills for their work.
